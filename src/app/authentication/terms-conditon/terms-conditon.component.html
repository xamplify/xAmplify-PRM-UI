           <p>Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, "Promotions") made available through the Service may
              be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms & Conditions. If you participate in any Promotions, please

           </p>
           <p>
              <strong>Subscriptions</strong>
           </p>
           <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on
              a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending
              on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
           </p>
           <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless
              you cancel it or xAmplify, Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online
              account management page or by contacting X-amplify’s customer support team.
           </p>
           <p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription.
              You shall provide xAmplify, Inc. with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address,
              state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information,
              you automatically authorize xAmplify, Inc. to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any
              such payment instruments.
           </p>
           <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, xAmplify, Inc. will issue an electronic invoice indicating
              that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing
              period as indicated on the invoice.
           </p>
           <p>
              <strong>Free Trial</strong>
           </p>
           <p> xAmplify, Inc. may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time
              ("Free Trial").
           </p>
           <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
           <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by xAmplify,
              Inc. until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription,
              you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
           </p>
           <p>At any time and without notice xAmplify, Inc.. reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the
              Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
           </p>
           <p>
              <strong>Fee Changes</strong>
           </p>
           <p>xAmplify, Inc. , in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions.
              Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
           </p>
           <p>xAmplify, Inc. will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an
              opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
           </p>
           <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement
              to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
           </p>
           <p>
              <strong>Refunds</strong>
