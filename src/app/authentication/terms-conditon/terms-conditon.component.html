        <strong>Subscriptions</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on
        a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending
        on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
      <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless
        you cancel it or StratApps, Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online
        account management page or by contacting X-amplifyâ€™s customer support team.</p>
      <p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription.
        You shall provide StratApps, Inc. with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state,
        zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically
        authorize StratApps, Inc. to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
      <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, StratApps, Inc. will issue an electronic invoice indicating
        that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing
        period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Free Trial</strong>
      </p>
      <p> StratApps, Inc. may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free
        Trial").</p>
      <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
      <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by StratApps,
        Inc. until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription,
        you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
      <p>At any time and without notice StratApps, Inc.. reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free
        Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>

      <p>StratApps, Inc. will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity
        to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
      <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to
        pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Refunds</strong>
