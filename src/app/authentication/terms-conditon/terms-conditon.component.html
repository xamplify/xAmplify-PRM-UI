          <strong>Subscriptions</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on
          a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending
          on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
        <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless
          you cancel it or xAmplify, Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online
          account management page or by contacting X-amplify’s customer support team.</p>
        <p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription.
          You shall provide xAmplify, Inc. with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address,
          state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information,
          you automatically authorize xAmplify, Inc. to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any
          such payment instruments.</p>
        <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, xAmplify, Inc. will issue an electronic invoice indicating

          Inc. until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription,
          you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>

        <p>xAmplify, Inc. will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an
          opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
        <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement
          to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Refunds</strong>
